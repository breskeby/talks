=== Kotlin based Gradle DSL

=== Motivation

* Current DSL was not designed for
** performance
** tooling friendlyness
* Limitations on bringing patterns and techniques from application level to build level

=== Kotlin (Management summary)

- Statically typed
- 1.0 released in 2016
- Driven by pragmatism
- Invented and maintained by Jetbrains
- Considerable uptake (particularly in the Android community).

=== Enticing Opportunities

* Proper IDE support
** Code completion
** Refactoring
** Documentation lookup
* Crafting DSLs with ease
** While keeping build scripts clean and declarative

=== Current state

* Working closely with Jetbrains
* Kotlin 1.1.0 support in Gradle 3.5
* v0.9.x in Gradle 4.0

=== Kotlin in Gradle
