== The Gradle Scripting Frontend

Declarative Build scripts using a

* Expressive DSL for describing builds
* Extensible with own DSL elements (e.g. android)
* Based on Groovy

=== Extensible DSL

[source,java]
----
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {...}
    buildTypes {...}
    productFlavors {
        demo {
            applicationId "com.acme.myapp.demo"
            versionName "1.0-demo"
        }
        full {
            applicationId "com.acme.myapp.full"
            versionName "1.0-full"
        }
    }
}
----

=== Current limitations

* DSL was not designed for performance
* Tooling friendlyness
* Limitations on bringing patterns and techniques from application level to build level

== Why Kotlin

- Gradle team watching Kotlin over the years
- Considerable uptake (particularly in the Android community).
- Jetbrains and Gradle start discussing benefits of joining forces

=== Enticing Opportunities

* Proper IDE support
** Code completion
** Refactoring
** Documentation lookup
* Crafting DSLs with ease
** While keeping build scripts clean and declarative

=== Gradle DSL vs. Kotlin features?

|===
|  		                |
|Expressiveness 	    | Lambda expressions
|                       | Lambdas with custom receiver
|Readability            | Extension members
|                       | Delegated members
|Concise & Declarative  | First class scripting
|Higly Performant       | Static typing
|                       | Vanilla JVM execution model
|                       | Inline functions
|Tooling friendly       | Deep IDE integration
|===

=== Design Constraints

* Preserve the use of 800+ Gradle plugins
* No magic: be transparent to tooling and users
* Leverage idiomatic Kotlin
* Ease of migration

=== Challenges

- From dynamic to static
- Self referential build script

=== Getting started with the Kotlin DSL
[source,java]
----
//settings.gradle
rootProject.buildFileName = 'build.gradle.kts'
----

=== Migrations

* Mix Groovy and Kotlin build scripts

=== Kotlin features

=== Demo
=== What's next

- Catching up to stable DSL  (e.g. plugins {})
- Performance: (compilation speed / script caching)
- settings.gradle.kts?
- Auto detect build.gradle.kts
- Update mechanism
