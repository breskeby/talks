== The Gradle Scripting Frontend

Declarative Build scripts using a

* Expressive DSL for describing builds
* Extensible with own DSL elements (e.g. android)
* based on Groovy

=== Current limitations

* DSL was not designed for performance
* Tooling friendlyness
* Bringing Patterns and techniques from application level to build level

== Why Kotlin

- Gradle team watching Kotlin over the years
- Considerable uptake (particularly in the Android community).
- Jetbrains and Gradle start discussing benefits of joining forces

=== Enticing Oppertunities

* Proper IDE support
** Refactoring
** Code completion
* Crafting DSLs with ease
** While keeping build scripts clean and declarative

=== Kotlin language
