Pleasant Build Script Authoring with Kotlin

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Hi! Good evening everyone. Thanks for coming.
--

== Rene Groeschke

* Principal Engineer at Gradle Inc.
* Opensource enthusiast
* Based in Berlin
* rene@gradle.com / @breskeby

== Agenda

* Motivation
* Aspects of Pleasant Build Script Authoring
* Challenges
* What's next

== Who are you?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Before we start, a quick show of hands.

* How many people know Kotlin?
* Who has a good grasp of the Gradle Groovy DSL?
* Who has a good grasp of the Gradle Kotlin DSL?
--

== Motivation

=== Current* limitations

* DSL was not designed for performance
* Tooling friendlyness
* Limitations on bringing patterns and techniques from application level to build level


=== Design Constraints

* Preserve the use of 1200+ Gradle plugins
* No magic: be transparent to tooling and users
* Leverage idiomatic Kotlin
* Ease of migration


== IDE support

- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse Buildship

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Everything that is demoed works in IDEA
- planned to be supported in Eclipse via Buildship
--

== Pleasant authoring experience?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- it's not about setting up a nice office so you can just code
- no I mean more specific things here
--

=== Quickness

[%step]
* Quick feedback
** the IDE helps, suggests, type-checks
* Quick access to documentation
* If it gets to that, quick access to source

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- is about beeing effective with minimum effort
- minimum effort to maximum result
- that means having quick feedback / stay in flow
    - when authoring build scripts
        - good suggestions
        - ensure code makes sense

- big part of writing build scripts is integrating
different plugins that extend functionality
    - make sense of these plugins
    - understand configuration options

- some plugins might not have enough documentation
- or curious about implementation details
--

=== Quickness

*DEMO*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- `hello-world` sample
- suggestions
    - available plugins (play)
    - documentation for play plugin
    - link to userguide
- type-checking
    - java version -> string
- documentation & source
    - go to source of mainClassName
--

=== Low cognitive overhead

[%step]
- You feel in control, never helpless
- Discoverability of the dynamic model

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- How many things you have to keep in mind to understand the context
- Offload all this context because the IDE will be here to help you
- Find the information you need *when* you need it
- Important with a dynamic model such as Gradle where plugins contribute
--

=== Low cognitive overhead

*DEMO*

[NOTE.speaker]
--

- `what-is-group` sample
- `application` plugin & its extension
--

=== Organizing build logic

[%step]
- To take the most advantage of the IDE
- With as less ceremony as possible

[NOTE.speaker]
--

- Only simple examples for now but in reality build logic is complex
- Tools managing this complexity
--

=== Organizing build logic

*DEMO*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Explain buildSrc
- Share a function
- Share a task type
- Authoring Gradle plugins
--

== Disclaimer

*We're not there yet!*

[%step]
- Asynchronous build script classpath resolution from IDEs
- Build logic organization refactorings in IDEs
- Better contextual suggestions in IDEs
- etc..

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Intro - goodness avail. today - more goodness avail. tomorrow
- making sure users are never blocked - async IDE
- build logic refactorings
- context specific suggestions
- etc..

- demo "this" & "this@"
--


== Challenges

[%step]
- Make the goodness available in all major IDEs

- Being able to write `settings.gradle.kts`

- Being able to write init scripts in Kotlin

- Making the plugins from the plugin portal discoverable from the IDE

- Better bridging across plugins written with only Groovy in mind

- Moving away from the `buildscript` block

[NOTE.speaker]
--

- IDE: public apis and models
- plugin portal support on par with built-in plugins
--

== How does it work?

//
// == What's next?
// [%step]
// * *Deprecate the `buildscript` block in favor of the `plugins` block*
// [%step]
// ** Allow plugins to declare api dependencies
// ** Allow script plugins to declare plugin dependencies
// ** Allow to apply script plugins from the `plugins` block
// ** Make community plugins available inside corporate environments
// ** Make the `plugins` block work across included builds in a composite build
//
// [NOTE.speaker]
// --
// - high on the list of our priorities
// - any contribution to the dynamic model is taken into account
// --

// == What's next?
// * Deprecate the `buildscript` block in favor of the `plugins` block
// * *Streamline build logic organization*
// [%step]
// ** Kotlin compiler plugins (allopen, ???)
// ** Share external plugin configuration code
//
// [NOTE.speaker]

== What's next?
* Deprecate the `buildscript` block in favor of the `plugins` block
* Streamline build logic organization
* *Documentation*
** Kotlin DSL API documentation
*** https://gradle.github.io/kotlin-dsl-docs/api/
** Kotlin snippets in the Gradle user manual and guides

- As we approach the 1.0 release we think this is the right time
- Confident that the DSL and IDE integration are in good shape
- It's a good time for you to provide your feedback to influence 1.0
