== The Gradle Scripting Frontend

Declarative Build scripts using a

* Based on Groovy
* Expressive DSL for describing builds
* Extensible with own DSL elements (e.g. android)

=== Extensible DSL

[source,java]
----
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {...}
    buildTypes {...}
    productFlavors {
        demo {
            applicationId "com.acme.myapp.demo"
            versionName "1.0-demo"
        }
        full {
            applicationId "com.acme.myapp.full"
            versionName "1.0-full"
        }
    }
}
----

=== Current limitations

* DSL was not designed for performance
* Tooling friendlyness
* Limitations on bringing patterns and techniques from application level to build level

== Kotlin in a nutshell

- Statically typed
- 1.0 released in 2016
- Driven by pragmatism
- Invented and maintained by Jetbrains
- Considerable uptake (particularly in the Android community).

=== Enticing Opportunities

* Proper IDE support
** Code completion
** Refactoring
** Documentation lookup
* Crafting DSLs with ease
** While keeping build scripts clean and declarative

=== Gradle DSL vs. Kotlin features?

|===
|  		                |
|Expressiveness 	    | Lambda expressions
|                       | Lambdas with custom receiver
|Readability            | Extension members
|                       | Delegated members
|Concise & Declarative  | First class scripting
|Highly Performant      | Static typing
|                       | Vanilla JVM execution model
|                       | Inline functions
|Tooling friendly       | Deep IDE integration

=== Design Constraints

* Preserve the use of 800+ Gradle plugins
* No magic: be transparent to tooling and users
* Leverage idiomatic Kotlin
* Ease of migration

== Challenges

=== From dynamic to static
[source,java]
----
apply plugin:'java'

dependencies {
    testCompile "junit:junit:4.10"
}
----

=== From dynamic to static
[source,java]
----
apply {
    plugin("java")
}

dependencies {
    "testCompile"("junit:junit:4.10")
}
----

=== From dynamic to static
[source,java]
----
apply {
    plugin("java")
}

dependencies {
    testCompile("junit:junit:4.10")
}
----

----
fun DependencyHandler.testCompile(dependencyNotation: Any) =
    add("testCompile", dependencyNotation)
----

=== Self referential build script
[source,java]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
            setUrl("https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/")
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("gradle.plugin.org.samples:publish-sample:1.0")
    }
}

task<GreetingTask>("greet"){
    greeting = "hello"
}
----

=== Gradle API patterns

- Action<T>
- Groovy Closures

=== Maintaining multiple frontends

* Catch up with latest Gradle features
* Ease the migration
* Preserve Gradle idioms

== Getting started
[source,java]
----
//settings.gradle
rootProject.buildFileName = 'build.gradle.kts'
----

=== See Some code

=== What's next

- Catching up to stable DSL  (e.g. plugins {})
- Performance: (compilation speed / script caching)
- settings.gradle.kts?
- Auto detect build.gradle.kts
- Update mechanism
